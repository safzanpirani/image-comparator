# Image Comparator

Image Comparator is a versatile web-based tool for various image manipulation tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for comparing, compressing, resizing, cropping, and flipping images. It was made as a simple bookmark to quickly resize/crop single images for social media, or other websites that don't offer great tools for editing your image before posting on a desktop/laptop.

## Features

- **Image Comparison**: Compare multiple images side by side and download the combined result.
- **Image Compression**: Compress both JPG and PNG images to reduce file size.
- **Image Resizing**: Resize images by specifying width, height, or scale percentage.
- **Image Cropping**: Crop images with various aspect ratio options.
- **Image Flipping**: Flip images horizontally or vertically.
