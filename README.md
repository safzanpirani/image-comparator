# Image Comparator

Image Comparator is a versatile web-based tool for various image manipulation tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for comparing, compressing, resizing, cropping, and flipping images. It was made as a simple bookmarkable tool to quickly edit single images for social media, or other websites that don't offer great tools for editing your image before posting on a desktop/laptop.
